Symbols used in the DFA TM

X represents aldready Read state
C represents the Current State Marker
Y represents the currently consumed input being run

subrule symbols
o (qi, n) = qj

D represents o the start of a subrule
N represents a incorrect transition function. Replaces D
x represents a marked qi
y represents a marked n
z represents a marked qj

F represents the final states of accepted States

Using the DFA TM as a base for the DPDA TM

These will be the added symbols for the Project (can change)
subrule(qi, n, r) = (qj, s)

r will be a marked pop
s will be a marked push 
m by default is lambda a empty push and pop 

Z will be the mark the start of the stack
