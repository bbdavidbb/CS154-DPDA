Symbols used in the DFA TM

X represents already Read state
C represents the Current State Marker
Y represents the currently consumed input being run

subrule symbols
o (qi, n) = qj

D represents o the start of a subrule
N represents a incorrect transition function. Replaces D
x represents a marked qi
y represents a marked n
z represents a marked current during chk_state
Z represents a marked Final state during chk_state

F represents the final states of accepted States

Using the DFA TM as a base for the DPDA TM

These will be the added symbols for the Project (can change)
subrule(qi, n, r) = (qj, s)

r will be a marked pop
s will be a marked push 
m by default is lambda a empty push and pop 
T will be the mark the start of the stack (Switched from Z because chk_final makes use of Z)
t is a temp variable marking stack and stop operations (Should be cleaned up during pop and push operations)
